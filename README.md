# ApplicationEngineering

Activity's instructions:

Open Eclipse or another Java IDE and create a new class.

Copy the following Main Method and paste it in you class.

	 public static void main(String[] args) {
	        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList();
	        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	            list.add(i);
	        }
	        System.out.println("The list of numbers is:");
	        for (int k = 0; k <=10; k++) {
	            System.out.println(list.get(k))
	        }
	    }

Correct the two mistakes in you code (the fact that you have to import java.util.ArrayList is not a mistake). If you can find only one of them, correct that one and then run the class.

Answer the following questions orally:

Which mistakes have you found?
Why can IDEs spot mistakes?
Which part of DevOps have you just used?
Are IDEs DevOps Softwares?
Whatâ€™s the big difference between coding with an IDE and coding with a text editor?
What would we need, if we wanted to practice with Continuous Deployment/Continuous Delivery, as well?
